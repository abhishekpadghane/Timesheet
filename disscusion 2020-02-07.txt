Topic: Building predictive model for PAM machine data.

Synopsis: As discussed, if more data is provided than finding relationship of variables
	will make sense. Prediction need to done on hourly basis considering input factors.
	output also need to be generic, not machine oriented because it may show some
	biased relation with respect to machine.

Requirements: 	1: Atleast 1 year data for understanding better relationship.
		2: More research on predicting results on hourly basis for a given day. 

Methodology:	1: Combining data in meaningful way.
		2: Finding relation of variables.
		3: Drawing some statistical conclusions.
		4: Building different models.
		5: Verifying model accuracy.
		6: Deploying selected model for predictions.

Current status: Observation, summary and analysis is done on provided data.

Further procedure: Working on finding documents, posts or articles related to hourly
		basis prediction results.
