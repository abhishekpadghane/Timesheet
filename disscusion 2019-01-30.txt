Topic: Building prediction model for combined data of both machine.

Synopsis: Now we have samples of day which are buckets that were created in data exploration of system health and data file
	, we are ready to perform prediction on combined data. Combined data consists of event info, output count and 
	automation time from PAM data files of both the machines.

Requirements: 	1: Bucket data of both files.
		2: output data from output file.
		3: automation info from system health file.

Methodology:	1: Need to make dataset in form of percentile buckets.
		2: Values will be picked considering percentile ranges or ranks.
		3: Prediction algorithm will be used on those values to predict required outcomes.

Current status: Combined data created by joining bucket data and output count data.

Further procedure: Working on percentile bucket creation.
