Topic: Building prediction model for combined data of both machine.

Synopsis: Now i have percentile bucket data in which i have considered values less than 80
		percent. I have also done feature engineering on data and created more 
		variables.

Requirements: 	1: Percentile bucket contains values less than.
		2: Checked accuracy of models.

Methodology:	1: Made train-test split by taking 70:30 train test ration.
		2: Apllied random forest regressor and SVR models on datasets.
		3: Checked model accuracy.

Current status: Predictive model is applied on data.

Further procedure: Working on scaling training data, finding best hyperparameters and
		applying KNN regressor to the data.
